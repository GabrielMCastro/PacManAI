Design:
Neural network with 3 hidden layers. 

{
    WALL    = 0;
    BISCUIT = 1;
    EMPTY   = 2;
    BLOCK   = 3;
    PILL    = 4;
}

Input layer takes (428 nodes): (All inputs should be normalized to be between 0-1)
    1. Map Space: 22*19 matrix, 418 nodes
    2. Player xy: 2 nodes -- (xy is in map-matrix input space)
    3. Enemies xy: 4 * 2, 8 nodes -- (xy is in map-matrix input space)
Layer 1:
    1. 12 neurons
Layer 2:
    1. 12 neurons
Layer 3:
    1. 12 neurons
Output Layer:
    1. 4 output neurons -- Each neuron represents a direction
        a. Left
        b. Right
        c. Up
        D. Down
    2. The neuron with the highest value is the decision chosen
        1. Value between 0 - 1 --- Sigmoidified

After each run, the networks with the highest fitness will be bred with each other for the next generation.
